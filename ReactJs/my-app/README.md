--Data tranfer:
1.props drilling |
2.context api    |--> to overcome these we use Redux library
3.state lift     |

    props drilling & context api :
        -from parent to any child or any grand-child

        state lift :
            -if you want to transfer data from one sibling to another sibling.

-redux:
-It is used to avoid all these three concepts, which is third party library.
